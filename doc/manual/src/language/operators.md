# Operators

## Select

> *e* `.` *attrpath* \[ `or` *def* \]

Select attribute denoted by the attribute path *attrpath* from set *e*. (An attribute path is a dot-separated list of attribute names.) If the attribute doesnâ€™t exist, return *def* if provided, otherwise abort evaluation.

Associativity: none

Precedence: 1

## Application

> *e1* *e2*

Call function *e1* with argument *e2*.

Associativity: left

Precedence: 2

## Arithmetic Negation

> `-` *e*

Arithmetic negation.

Associativity: none

Precedence: 3

## Has Attribute

> *e* `?` *attrpath*

Test whether set *e* contains the attribute denoted by *attrpath*; return `true` or `false`.

Associativity: none

Precedence: 4

## List Concatenation

> *e1* `++` *e2*

List concatenation.

Associativity: right

Precedence: 5

## Multiplication

> *e1* `*` *e2*,

## String Concatenation

> *string1* `+` *string2*

String concatenation.

Associativity: left

Precedence: 7

## Not

> `!` *e*

Boolean negation.

Associativity: none

Precedence: 8

## Update

> *e1* `//` *e2*

Return a set consisting of the attributes in *e1* and *e2* (with the latter taking precedence over the former in case of equally named attributes).

Associativity: right

Precedence: 9
